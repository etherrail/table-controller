# Table Controller
Ever wanted to control your trains like a real locomotive operator? 
Just 3D-print this controller, minor electronics and off you go.

## Assembly
1. 3D print the STL files from the `model` directory, using your table thickness (currently only 19mm)
2. Add two M4 nuts into their cages on the bottom of the clip
3. Add two M4 nuts from the bottom of the base, thru the plastic part and the nuts
4. Add a potentiometer, solder it to a 5mm wire and create the matching electronics
5. Screw in the potentiometer thru the bottom base
6. Bend a 8mm aluminum rod (not tube) 80degrees at 6cm
7. Cut off the rod after ~25cm. This will be your lever
8. Glue the rod into the circler
9. Squeeze the circler onto the potentiometer head
10. Drive three wood screws thru the bottom base into the top to permanently hold the base together
11. Put the controller onto the side of your table
12. Screw in the M4 screws until the base is fixed
